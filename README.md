## About Me
I'm Mazhar Ali, a dedicated 3rd-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision. I love uncovering insights from data and developing intelligent systems that make AI more efficient and smarter.
<br><br><br>
With expertise in SQL, I efficiently manipulate and analyze data using joins, window functions, and group by operations. Additionally, I am skilled in Microsoft Excel and Power BI, enabling me to create insightful visualizations that enhance decision-making.
<br><br><br>
My journey in Computer Science has also led me to explore Image Processing, where I have worked with OpenCV to process images, apply filters, and extract meaningful features. This experience fueled my interest in Computer Vision, leading me to specialize in object detection and model optimization using YOLO.
<br><br><br>
Beyond vision-based AI, I have a strong foundation in Machine Learning, particularly in predictive modeling with scikit-learn. Leveraging PyTorch and TensorFlow, I focus on improving model efficiency and performance. Currently, I am eager to expand my knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore their transformative potential in AI applications.
